Create a Spring Boot API in Java.

1. Use Spring RestTemplate to get data from this JSON file:
https://www.retriever-info.com/doccyexample/documents.json
It contains social media posts extracted from one of our microservices.

2. Filter the result to match hits with a story that contains a specified
search word. Ex. magicthegathering.

3. Get the searchword as a paramter from the request.

4. Encapsulate the story in the hits with <b>searchstring</b>

5. Bonus task.
Present the output as JSON objects.
Input parameter is the "id" field of the parent/starting post of a tree
structure.
Try using a recursive function to make the tree.
Populate it by using the relationship between "author.id" and "mentioned".
In practice - find where an author is mentioned and where its mentioned
authors are in turn mentioned, and so on...
The post with id "75010_1039797434598051840_1048664"
has an author that is mentioned more than once - you might be able to
find starting posts that generate bigger trees.
